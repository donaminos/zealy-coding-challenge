# Reactor

I decided to start over and build the feature from scratch because I am not satisfied with what I have built in the previous branch.
By taking the time to build this feature from scratch without time constraints, I aim to achieve a level of quality that meets my personal standards.

The primary motivation is to fill the knowledge gap that held me back from shipping a great feature in 2H. It's an opportunity to learn and grow, regardless of the outcome of the interview.

As the saying goes "Great artists copy", I have decided to implement a comment feature similar to that found in Figma.
